# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains code for sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews. Sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. In the context of restaurant reviews, sentiment analysis can help restaurants understand customer feedback and gauge overall customer satisfaction.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiment expressed. In this project, we use a machine learning model trained on a labeled dataset of restaurant reviews to perform sentiment analysis.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: nltk, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the sentiment analysis model consists of restaurant reviews labeled with their corresponding sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). The dataset should ideally be balanced across different sentiment classes to ensure the model's effectiveness.

## Preprocessing

Before training the model, the text data undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, removing stopwords, stemming, and vectorization. These steps help in converting the raw text data into a format suitable for training the machine learning model.

## Model Training

We train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data. Popular algorithms for sentiment analysis include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and deep learning-based models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the task and the characteristics of the dataset.

## Evaluation

After training the model, we evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test dataset. These metrics provide insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data and its ability to correctly classify reviews into different sentiment categories.

## Usage

1. **Training**: To train the sentiment analysis model, run the `train.py` script after configuring the appropriate hyperparameters and file paths.

2. **Testing**: After training, you can test the model's performance using the `test.py` script on a separate test dataset.

3. **Prediction**: Once trained, the model can be used to predict the sentiment of new restaurant reviews by calling the `predict_sentiment()` function with the text input.

## Future Improvements

- Fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures.
- Incorporating more advanced text preprocessing techniques.
- Handling imbalanced datasets effectively.
- Building a web interface or API for real-time sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews.
